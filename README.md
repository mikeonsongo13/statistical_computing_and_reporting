# Linear Algebra in python 
This article will show you how to perform some linear algebra calculations using python.
To be specific using the NumPy module.
Numpy is a python module widely used to handle n-dimensional arrays.
Numpy can handle large Multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with an extensive collection of mathematical operations to operate on the arrays. It stands for Numerical python.
Arrays occupy less space and are extremely convenient to use as compared to python lists. Also, it has a mechanism for specifying data types.
Numerous problems in science and engineering can be described or approximated by linear relationships. For example, if you combined resistors in a complicated circuit, you will obtain a system of linear relationships.
## Sets
In mathematics, a set is a collection of objects. A set is denoted be braces{} for example t={2,4,6,8,10}
An empty set is denoted by {} empty braces or by  ∅ . Given two sets A and B 
the intersect is denoted by A ∩ B set of all the elements in both A and B.
 the union is denoted by A∪B set of all the elements of A and B.
The colon is used to mean "such that". \ is used to mean the complement of a set. In mathematics, there are various types of sets that are related to numbers real, integers irrational, complex, whole, and rational numbers.
A set is defined as follows 

***
S={(x,y):x,y∈R,x2+y2=1} 
which means S is a set of all real numbers (x,y) such that x2+y2=1

## vectors
The set  R^n is the set of all n-tuples of real numbers. In set notation this is R^n={(x1,x2,x3,⋯,xn):x1,x2,x3,⋯,xn∈R}.For example the set R^3 represents the set of real triples (x,y,z) coordinates in the 3D space.
A vecotr in R^n is a n-tuple in R^n. vectros can be written horizontally(row vector) and vertically (column vector).
The normal of a vector is measure of the length of a vector  L2 most common norm "euclidian distance" denoted by||v2||
∥v∥2=√∑iv2i.
